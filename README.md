Handwritten-Digits-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-Python-KNN

* Implemented KNN algorithm from scratch (used only Python Numpy and Matplotlib Libraries) to predict digits 5 and 6 accurately 
* Trained algorithm on 1000 images of 1024 pixel sizes (32 x 32)
* 10-folds cross validation by dividing training dataset into train and validation data
* Hyperparameter tuning result: optimum k = 6 nearest neighbours
* Accuracy of prediction on test data (110 separate images): 78.18 %
